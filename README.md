# Cookie-Monster
a CLI used to identify tracking cookies for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and possibly other browsers down the line. NOTE: this program was developed for my own use and to increase awareness on Cross Site Cookies, Online Privacy and digital stalking done by Data Brokers. Check the README for further questions, concerns and for documentation.
